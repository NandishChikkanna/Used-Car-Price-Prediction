# OVERVIEW

In this application, you will explore a dataset from Kaggle. The original dataset contained information on 3 million used cars. The provided dataset contains information on 426K cars to ensure speed of processing.  Your goal is to understand what factors make a car more or less expensive.  As a result of your analysis, you should provide clear recommendations to your client -- a used car dealership -- as to what consumers value in a used car.

## CRISP-DM Framework

To frame the task, throughout our practical applications, we will refer back to a standard process in industry for data projects called CRISP-DM.  This process provides a framework for working through a data problem.  Your first step in this application will be to read through a brief overview of CRISP-DM [here](https://mo-pcco.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/BH-PCMLAI/module_11/readings_starter.zip).  After reading the overview, answer the questions below.

# Business Understanding

From a business perspective, we are tasked with identifying key drivers for used car prices.  In the CRISP-DM overview, we are asked to convert this business framing to a data problem definition.  Using a few sentences, reframe the task as a data task with the appropriate technical vocabulary. 

### Objective :

To develop a supervised machine learning regression model to predict the price of used vehicles based on a range of features such as:
- year, 
- manufacturer, 
- model, 
- condition, 
- mileage (odometer), 
- fuel type, 
- transmission, and 
- body type. 

The goal is to identify the most influential variables that impact vehicle pricing, enabling data-driven insights into the key drivers of used car values.

### Data Exploration Plan

### 1. Initial Data Exploration

- Load the dataset and view the first few rows (`df.head()`)
- Understand the structure using `.info()` and `.describe()`
- Check the shape (rows x columns) with `df.shape`
- Identify data types: numeric, categorical, date, text

### 2. Understand the Target Variable

- Examine the distribution of price (our target)
  - Histogram, boxplot to detect outliers
  - Check for unreasonable values (e.g. 0, extremely high prices)

### 3. Missing Values Analysis

- Use `df.isnull().sum()` and percentage calculations to:
  - Identify columns with missing values
  - Estimate how serious the missingness is
- Consider if missing data is random or has a pattern

### 4. Duplicate and Invalid Data

- Check for duplicate rows or records with `df.duplicated().sum()`
- Validate key columns like year, odometer, price, VIN
  - Example: year should be between 1900 and current year
  - Odometer and price should not be negative or unreasonably high

### 5. Categorical Features Exploration

- Use `value_counts()` for:
  - Manufacturer, fuel, transmission, condition, type, state, etc.
- Identify dominant categories vs. rare ones (long tails)

### 6. Numeric Features Exploration

- Visualize odometer, year, price with histograms, KDE plots
- Detect skewness or strange distributions
- Check correlations between numerical variables and price

### 7. Relationship Analysis

- Use visualizations to explore:
  - Price vs. Year (newer cars = higher price?)
  - Price vs. Mileage (higher mileage = lower price?)
  - Price vs. Manufacturer, Condition, etc.

### 8. Data Consistency Checks

- Look for inconsistencies:
  - Mismatched year and model
  - Condition labeled as "new" with high mileage
  - Transmission or fuel with unexpected values or typos


# üßº Data Preparation Plan

## ‚úÖ 1. Handle Missing Values

- Drop or fill missing values, depending on the column and business logic

## ‚úÖ 2. Remove Outliers & Invalid Data

- Filter out unreasonable price, year, odometer values

## ‚úÖ 3. Encode Categorical Variables

- Use One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding where appropriate

## ‚úÖ 4. Feature Engineering (Optional)

- Create new features (e.g., car age)

## ‚úÖ 5. Transformations

- Log-transform skewed variables like price, odometer
- Scale numerical features with StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler


# üéØ Modeling Plan

## üî¢ Models to Try:

- Linear Regression
- Ridge Regression (regularized)
- Random Forest Regressor
- Gradient Boosting Regressor

## ‚úÖ Tasks:

- Fit models using a pipeline
- Use cross-validation (`cross_val_score`)
- Compare RMSE across models


# Comparison of Regression Models

Using a sampled dataset and faster 3-fold cross-validation, we compared the performance of several regression models. As you can see:

- **Gradient Boosting** performed the best with the lowest RMSE.
- **Random Forest** was a close second.
- **Linear and Ridge Regression** had similar, slightly higher errors.

## Results Summary

| Model                  | RMSE       |
|------------------------|------------|
| Gradient Boosting      | Lowest     |
| Random Forest          | Close Second|
| Linear Regression      | Higher     |
| Ridge Regression       | Higher     |

## Conclusion

Gradient Boosting is the most effective model for this dataset, followed closely by Random Forest. Linear and Ridge Regression models have higher errors but are still useful for comparison.


# ‚úÖ Model Evaluation Summary

## üéØ Business Objective Recap

We set out to identify the key drivers of used car prices and build a predictive model to estimate those prices based on vehicle features. This would enable better pricing strategies, valuation tools, or insights into market behavior.

## üß† What We Learned

### Model Performance

- **Final model**: Gradient Boosting Regressor (tuned)
- **R¬≤ Score**: ~0.77 ‚Üí The model explains 76.87% of the variance in used car prices.
